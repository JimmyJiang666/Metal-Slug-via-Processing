# Player-Unknown
Player Unknown will be a side-scrolling video game in which the player controls ‘the captain’. The captain’s mission is to survive and reach the destination, which can be represented by a flagpole like the one in Super Mario. Object-oriented programing will be applied to create classes such as creatures and collectible objects. Player Unknown will be a side-scrolling video game in which the player controls ‘the captain’.
